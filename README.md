### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Mussie!

I am a *Structural Engineer* and *AEC software Developer* with a special interest in
driving sustainability, promoting circular economy and resource efficiency in
the built environment using advanced digital technologies.

My experience focused on pre-processing 2D images, 3D point cloud and tabular
data and analysing the information in the data pipeline to develop innovative
Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing based digital products that
play a pivotal role in driving sustainability and circular economy in the built
environment.

I am now looking for new challenges where I can develop scalable digital
products and data-driven solutions that support digital innovation and informed
decision-making in the AEC industry.

I am also open to exploring and learning from other disciplines, and bonus
point, if I can collaborate with like-minded, cross-disciplinary engineers!

Please feel free to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mussie-birhane-92b0ba156/) and
explore the possibilities of working together to drive meaningful change.
